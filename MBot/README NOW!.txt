OK, first...some credit goes to Sagoza/Kaverin of #visualbasic/#vb on dalnet for the vbTimer.dll even tho he wasn't nice enough to give me the code. ;)

the tray dll is my code from a different submission to PSC(which no one voted for might i add).

to use this app register the dlls, play with the PDK (Plugin Development Kit), i included a simple plugin for u to get the jist of it ;)

find any errors or want some features added, email me (mudblood@blueyonder.co.uk) or leave a comment on the submission.

one more thing, if vb cant find the core dll, its called server.dll and is in BIN dir.
and another! a plugin will only be found valid if 1) the filename is the same as the project name(without the .dll) and the class is called plugin. 

lastly PLEASE VOTE! i put lots of effort into this submission. :)
